### Project Motivation

My aim in this project is to analyze prices of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam, focusing primarily on comparing average prices (per person per night) in different city districts, and trying to identify other price drivers that might be interesting to the visitors of Amsterdam.

The analysis provides a general overview of the Airbnb market in Amsterdam, but can also serve as a guide to all visitors who are interested in where to stay if travelling on budget, or how large is the premium for more central apartments. By using text processing techniques I also analyze user reviews to find out which parts of the city the users think are well-located. I find out that the share of reviews that specifically praise the location is in fact a solid price predictor, as linear relationship is observed between the two variables. Through this analysis I also identify districts that are under or over priced given their location.

Location is obviously one of the main drivers when it comes to renting out an Airbnb apartment, but there are of course many other aspects that impact the prices. My analysis goes beyond just comparing the average prices of different districts. I analyze the listings' names and descriptions in specific districts to answer questions such as how much extra on average one needs to pay if the flat is advertised as luxurious, spacious, cosy, modern,etc., or how large is the premium for having a garden, or very specific to Amsterdam, how much more expensive it is to stay just next to a canal, or on it - in a houseboat.

In summary, I want to answer 3 specific questions:
- compare average price per person per night between different neighborhoods in Amsterdam
- analyze whether the average prices in Amsterdam districts are correlated with the ratio of reviews that specifically praise the flat location
- find out how much extra one needs to pay on average for a flat advertised (in the name or description) as luxurious, spacious, modern, having a garden, being close to a canal, etc.
